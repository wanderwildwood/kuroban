 * Two settings, because on a 9x9 board GNU Go only has two.
 *
 * Measured by self-play, colours alternating: levels 1 and 3 are indistinguishable from

 * margin a tenth of a point). The only real step is between 3 and 5. Level 10 therefore
 * costs ten times the thinking time of level 5 - 3.4s against 0.33s per move on the
 * Kompakt, in a middlegame - and plays no better for it.
 *
 * A third, genuinely stronger setting was looked for and does not exist at a usable speed.
 * GNU Go's Monte Carlo mode, which it provides for 9x9 and smaller, does beat classic
 * level 10 (7-1 over 8 games, +6.2 points) - but it takes 14s a move on this phone, and
 * its strength is in the sheer number of simulations. Cheapening it to `--monte-carlo
 * --level 1`, at 1.3s a move, throws away the thing that made it strong: 26-28 over 54
 * games against classic level 5, which is a coin. There is no fast version of it.
 *
 * So the ladder stops at 5, and handicap is the dial for anything finer. That is the
 * Go-native answer anyway: handicap is how the game has always handled unequal players.
